**Location:** Tel Aviv University  
**Theme:** Comic Book Multiverse Edition

## About the AI Village

The AI Village at BSides TLV is a community-driven track exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. As AI systems become deeply embedded in infrastructure, security tools, and everyday operations, understanding how to break, secure, and stress-test these systems is no longer optional ‚Äî it's essential.

New for 2025, the AI Village was created to address the growing need for practical, community-driven exploration of AI security threats.

üìÖ Join us on June 26, 2025, at BSides TLV to be part of Israel's first AI security village.

### üîç What

The AI Village is a focused track at BSides TLV dedicated to the security of AI systems. Through a curated lineup of technical talks and expert-led discussions, we unpack real-world attack surfaces across AI-powered technologies ‚Äî from model red teaming and prompt injection, to data poisoning, misuse, and adversarial manipulation.

### ‚ùì Why

AI systems are being deployed across every sector ‚Äî from critical infrastructure to national defense ‚Äî but they bring with them new, often poorly understood attack surfaces.

The AI Village brings together hackers, engineers, and researchers who are actively probing these systems ‚Äî sharing insights, tooling, and tradecraft to help the wider community secure AI in practice, not just in theory.

### üéØ Mission

To build a technically grounded, hands-on community in Israel focused on the secure and responsible use of AI. We aim to bridge the gap between AI practitioners and security professionals by fostering open collaboration, practical knowledge exchange, and applied research.

### üåü Vision

A future where AI systems are designed with security at their core ‚Äî scrutinized, stress-tested, and improved by communities that understand how they can be manipulated, exploited, or fail in the real world.

### ü§ù Who Should Join?

If you're curious about how AI systems break ‚Äî and how to secure them ‚Äî you belong here. Whether you're a security researcher, AI practitioner, policy wonk, or hacker at heart, the AI Village is your space to engage, share, and learn.
